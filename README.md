# todo - WIP 🚧 (Pushing bc U know how loosing code feels like )

`A Clojure library designed to ... well, that part is up to you.` 

Ok Lein... I take from here, this is a simple project for a REST API using clojure for learning purposes.

## Development environment

⚙Specs:
- Postgres: 13.2-1.pgdg100+1
- Clojure: 1.10.2
- Lein: Leiningen 2.9.5 on Java 11.0.10 OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM
- Computer: 
  - i5 6600k
  - 16GB DDR4 2400Mhz
  - Ubuntu 20.04

## Step by step to execute 💨

First of all, make sure your Postgres server is up and running - [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql) enviroments make its use easier. Then you can clone the repository with:  

```bash
git clone DESIRED_DIR_NAME git@github.com:breno12321/TodoApp-clojure.git
```

Done clonning, you can now configure the env file, doing 

```bash
vi .env.development
```

After setting up the enviroment you can run: 
```bash
lein deps
```
Then Leiningen will get all the dependencies, with them all setup you can run:

```bash
lein run
``` 
 
It will be running on `http://localhost:3000` for development purposes👨‍💻, hot reload for file modifications due to dev profile.

## Documentation 📕
